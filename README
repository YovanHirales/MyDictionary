A personal dictionary web application.
This application takes in words as inputs and creates cards of the words along with their definition, pulled from Wordnik's dictionary API.

To run this program locally, open the terminal inside the root directory of the program and type in "npm start" to start the node server.
Then in a seperate terminal navigate to the client directory and type in "npm start" again this time to start the REACT application.
You will also need the postgres application running on port 5432. Inside the root directory there is a file called database.sql which contains the commands to set up the database.

Alternatively, you can view a live demo of the website here: https://mydictionary-d5eae45bfa0c.herokuapp.com/
